# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose

The purpose of the project was to scrape information and images from various active websites that displayed gathered information regarding a Mission to Mars. Web Scraping is an automated technique used to gather data quickly using a programming script, instead of having to manually copy and paste gathered information. Chrome Developer Tools were used to identify HTML components of the different websites. BeautifulSoup and Splinter was used to automate the web browser scrape and to gather the identified data. A no SQL database tool, Mongo, was used to store the data. A web application, Flask, was used to display the stored data.
